# Environmental-Microbial-Methanotroph-Interactions
This is a collection of analysis used in the paper "Environmental and Microbial Interactions Shape Methane-Oxidizing Bacterial Communities in a Stratified Lake" by  Guggenheim et al.

The data set consists of 16S rRNA and pMOA genes based data that were mined for possible interactions with itself and the environment of a stratified lake. The main analysis consists of different multivariate and network based approaches that can be tailored to investigate the data set from single bacterial players to the total community dynamic.
