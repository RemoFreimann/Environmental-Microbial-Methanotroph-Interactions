# Environmental-Microbial-Methanotroph-Interactions
This is a collection of analyses used in the paper "Environmental and Microbial Interactions Shape Methane-Oxidizing Bacterial Communities in a Stratified Lake" by  Guggenheim et al.

The data set consists of 16S rRNA and pMOA genes based sequencing and physico-chemical as well as habitat zonation data. The R scripts mine for structures and interactions of the bacterial communities with themselves and their surrounding environment. The analyses consist of different multivariate and network based approaches that can be tailored to investigate the data set from the level of single bacterial players to the total community dynamic by using the three different datasets in specific combinations.
